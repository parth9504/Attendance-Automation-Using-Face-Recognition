# Attendance-Automation-Using-Face-Recognition

This is an Attendance Automation Application with the ability to record attendance by the recognition of faces using webcam.
The project used **dlib**, a C++ toolkit which provides multiple **machine learning algorithms** and for making other data analysis applications.

Besides this ,the project used python's **Face Recognition Module**, a deep learning model which finds the encodings of faces and stores them in form of vectors.
The pretrained model internally uses Histogram of Gradients and Convolution Neural Network for finding the gradients in localized portions of an image.
The project also included the option to view attendance for which csv library was used, allowing the access of csv files,adding content to them and opening them when needed.For the user interface, streamlit library was used.

The photos attached below show a demonstration of this project.
